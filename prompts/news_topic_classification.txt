- Return a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains:
  - `"id_"`: The unique identifier of the news item.
  - `"category"`: The most relevant category from the list.
- If the title is ambiguous, choose the **closest** category based on common journalistic themes.
- If no category is applicable, return `"Other"`.
